# Diet-Index-HEI
R code for calculating HEI-2015 from NDSR files 4 and 9
The data frame is created by importanting an excel file that contains file 4 and file 9 from each participant.  One diet recall for participant, one row per participant.
The data farem is called df49 (indicating the NDSR files)
All code comes from modifying SAS code and leaning on the source code for the previous HEI R package. https://github.com/timfolsom/hei/blob/master/R/hei.R
